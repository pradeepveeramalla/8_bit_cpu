🚀 Exciting Announcement: 8-bit CPU Design Series in Verilog!
Hello Community! 👋



I’m thrilled to announce that I will be sharing a series of posts on designing an 8-bit CPU using Verilog. This journey will take us from the basics of digital design to the intricate details of a fully functional CPU🖥️. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced hardware designer, there will be something for everyone!✨

1. Basic Logic Gates (AND, OR, NOT)
2. Combinational Circuits (Multiplexers, Encoders)
3. Sequential Circuits (Flip-Flops, Counters)
4. Simple ALU Design ⚙️
5. Register File Implementation
6. Control Unit Design
7. Datapath Design
8. Full CPU Design 🧠💡


💡Why Follow This Series?

. Learn by Doing: Practical Verilog code examples and simulations.
. Step-by-Step Guidance: Clear explanations from basic to advanced concepts.
. Engagement: Interactive posts with questions and discussions.
. Networking: Connect with like-minded professionals and enthusiasts.
